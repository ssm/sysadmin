# Exim router for virtual domains
#
# Stig Sandbeck Mathisen <ssm@fnord.no>

# Installation:
#
# Add the contents of this file to the "routers" section, at an appropriate
# place
#
# For debian with split-config, use a file name prefixed by a number to adjust
# precedence, like /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/350_local_virtual_domain_aliases
#
# Usage: 
#
# This file assumes that you have your virtualdomain setup in
# /etc/mail/domains, with one file per domain, where the file name is the same
# as the domain name.  The content is the same as a normal aliases file.
#
# Example domain "example.org" in the file /etc/mail/domains/example.org
#
# root:       someone@example.org
# postmaster: someone
# abuse:      postmaster
# info:       someone
# nobody:     /dev/null
# someone:    my_mail_account@my_mail_provider.example.com
